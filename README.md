# DotCrawlPlus
Avisynth dot crawl effect (make your video ugly on purpose)

This is a mirror of an AviSynth .avsi plugin, originally uploaded on DropBox and posted on doom9 on 3rd April 2014, 21:57 *(GMT -3:00)*.
I've been thinking of making an fork to update some things like making the rainbowing more realistic and noticeable.

The fork will be made soon, but for while here's the original version, as well the poisondeathray *(videohelp.com)*'s port to AVS+.

Inspired by recently reading the [Avisynth gone wrong](http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=144861) thread here, and spurred on by a question on another forum (Betacam/betacam Sp Effect For Virtualdub?), I give you **dotcrawlplus**, an Avisynth dot crawl effect. For convenience, it can blur the chroma and add noise at the same time. There's a wrapper function with a few named presets, or you can set all the options directly.

It's not terribly elegant. I'm sure the effect could be refined. It's intended for use as a quick special effect for a music video or whatnot; it's not a very good composite video emulator. You are not going to fool an expert with it. (I suggest a hardware solution for a perfect emulation)
